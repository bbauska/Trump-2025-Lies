Drug prices have dropped 200, 300, 400, 600%. That is a quote from asshole in charge. It's not possible. University of Pennsylvania gave this moron a college degree in economics. Fuck them for that!

We don’t know what Mr. Trump’s GPA was, and despite his multiple demands during the campaign that Obama release his transcripts ( "I heard [Obama] was a terrible student, terrible...I'm thinking about it, I'm certainly looking into it. Let him show his records."), Mr. Trump has failed to produce his transcripts when asked.

What we do know is that Mr. Trump graduated with a bachelor’s degree from Wharton without honors and that one of his professors there is reported to have said “Donald Trump was the dumbest goddam student I ever had.”

(By contrast Obama graduated with honors magna cum laude from Harvard Law School and in the top 10 per cent of his class.)

Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed to have “the highest IQ”, to “test much higher than Obama”, and to be a “genius”. But when asked to verify his IQ, Trump responded only with “The highest, asshole” (on Twitter, of course).

And though he challenged both his former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and London Mayor Sadiq Khan (along with former Presidential rival Rick Perry) to an IQ test, Trump never followed through with it, even when offers were made to conduct such a test.

It’s just a guess on my part, but I’d venture to say that Mr. Trump has not released his transcripts because they would come closer to supporting his ex-professor’s assessment than his own extravagant claims.
